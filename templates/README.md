# Documentation Templates

This section contains AsciiDoc templates which you can use as a starting point for your own documentation.

## Instructions

1. Start by copying the template for the type of topic you are writing.
   You could set up your editor to suggest a template when you create a new file.

2. Edit the new document, using the suggested structure and architecture, but replacing the running text as required.

## Topic Types

The templates are divided into four topic types.
Within each of those topic types there may be a number of templates.

* Tutorials -- learning
* How-to Guides -- tasks
* Explanation -- concepts
* Reference -- information

For further information, refer to https://documentation.divio.com.
